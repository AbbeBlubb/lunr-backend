<H1>School Reports and Term Papers: The ACE Collection</H1>
<P>
In 1994, Arrogant Couriers with Essays (ACE) went back to basics and improved the
distribution methods, classification, and approach to online school essays. The result
is this large collection of reports, stories, and summaries of an amazing range of
subjects. The efforts of this group to accomplish both usefulness and speed of research
are reflected in the (mostly) accurate summaries and classifications that appear at the
top of the files. If known, the grade level, state, and the occasional short review are
given for easy browsing. 
<P>
Regardless of the opinion of these sort of "cheat sheets", the implementation is admirable.
